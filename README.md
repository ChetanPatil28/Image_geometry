This repo is for sole purpose of understanding how a 3-d object is rendered in a Computer Screen particulary in a Game Engine.
Of-course I needed some Interface-Utilities such as a Game-Loop, basic things such as Drawing a point on a screen,
filling it with colors etc.

For this purpose, I have used the "olcConsoleGameEngine.h" Header-file from https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/videos repo.

The author also of this repository has his YouTube channel where he teaches about a lot of things related to Computer Science.
I would definitely recommend to check out his YouTube series on Game-Engine.

Here is the link to his YouTube channel- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA
